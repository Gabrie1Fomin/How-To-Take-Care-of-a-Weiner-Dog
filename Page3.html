        >This one is the hardest. Because these little rascals cannot speak, they communicate via yips and yaps.<br>
        Occasionaly, you may be met with some pounces in which they express their utmost concerns with a silly and cute protest.<br>
        It is important to make sure your dog feels seen. If you laugh at their protest, they will continue to do so.<br>
        Take them seriously. They have a lot on their scheduele and getting laughed at isn't one of them.<br>
        Garfunkle is adamant on having one of my hats. Because of this, I have given him one of my favorite hats and watched him mangle it to shreds.<br>
        Now, people may say "don't give your dogs belongings to chew!" But how could I when Garfunkle asked nicely and he treats his toys with respect?<br>
        He even has his own pair of Crocs he's allowed to chew!
