        >This one is the hardest. Because these little rascals cannot speak,<br>
        they communicate via yips and yaps. Occasionaly, you may be met with some <br>
        pounces in which they shal express their utmost concerns with a silly and cute protest.<br>
        It is important to make sure your dog feels seen. If you laugh at their protest, they will continue.<br>
        Take them seriously. They have a lot on their scheduele and getting laughed at isn't one of them.</p>
