    <h1 class=".rainbow-text"; style="text-align: center">Giving lots of Chewies</h1>
    <p style="text-align: center;"> Giving your Dachshund chewies is important due to its ability to up your "cool points" with your dog.<br>
    If your dog does not recieve a daily chewy, he will become frustrated and will try to voice his concerns.<br>
    For my dog, the daily chewy marks the moment in which I leave for classes. I like to consider it a farewell gift.<br>
    He considers it as a peace offering in exchange for not destroying my room while I'm gone.</p>
